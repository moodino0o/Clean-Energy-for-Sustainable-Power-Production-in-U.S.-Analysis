# Clean Energy for Sustainable Power Production In U.S. Analysis
Technical analysis of US power plants production, location and efficiency to find the best candidates of renewable energies for Bahrain's power system 

# Scenario
Sustainable energy is one of the key SDGs that Bahrain aims to achieve by 2050. To move toward this objective, the country is reducing its reliance on natural gas by integrating renewable power sources into its energy mix. The United States, one of the global leaders in renewable energy deployment, offers valuable insights and best practices. Studying the U.S. experience can help Bahrain identify effective strategies and adapt suitable technologies.

# Approaches
•	Comparison between renewables and non-renewables
1.	Efficiency (fuel converted to electricity / total fuel supplied)
2.	Lost fuel
3.	Location
4.	Generation / plant size
5.	No. of plants
6.	Fuel Efficiency (Heat Rate)

•	Comparison between renewables
1.	Efficiency
2.	Lost fuel
3.	Location
4.	No. of plants
5.	Generation / size
6.	Cost

• Most Suitable renewable power plant depending on Bahrain’s conditions.

# Dataset Overview

## Operators Dataset

Data Sources: U.S. Energy Information Administration
Data Size: 157 K Rows
Data Period: 2015 - 2025
      Key Features:
      •	Plant Name & ID
      •	Net Generation
      •	Electric fuel consumption
      •	Total fuel consumption
      •	Primary Mover

## Weather Data
      
Data Sources: National Solar Radiation Database
Data Period: 2022
      Key Features:
      •	Location
      •	Temperature
      •	Wind Speed

# Insights & Findings
## Operational Performance
  •	Which type of energy source demonstrates the highest operational performance?
  •	Which type of energy source generates the greatest amount of electricity?
  Insights: Carbon free is the most efficient category and produces the highest amount of electricity per area, while non-renewables are the most contributing category in US power production.
  
## Infrastructure Analysis
  •	In which U.S. states is each energy source type most highly concentrated?
  Insights: California is the highest state that contains both renewable and non-renewable energy sources, where solar is the highest renewable source in it. Wind plants concentrated in Texas while nuclear is in Illinois. Renewable plants are the most increasing category in number of plants over years.
  
## Cost Analysis
  •	Which type of energy source is the most economically and technically feasible to develop?
  Insights: From clean energy, nuclear plants are the costliest plants in terms of operation and maintenance followed by geothermal. While solar is the cheapest.
  
## Bahrain Candidates
  •	Which type of renewable energy is most suitable for deployment in Bahrain?
  Insights: Analysis and research reached that nuclear and geothermal are the most suitable plants for Bahrain’s conditions in terms of cost, area, and generation.

# Limitations
1.	Dataset is limited to US only and doesn’t consider the local conditions.
2.	Dataset doesn’t include the exact size of the plant, only a point coordinates.
3.	It includes the consumption of fuel for renewable energies in MMBTUs while there is no actual burning of use in the process.
